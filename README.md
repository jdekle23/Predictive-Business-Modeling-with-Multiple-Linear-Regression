# Predictive Business Modeling with Multiple Linear Regression

This project was developed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Specialization (Course 5)** on Coursera.  
It demonstrates how to plan, build, and interpret a multiple linear regression model to solve a real-world business problem.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This end-of-course project simulates a business case study where multiple independent variables are analyzed to predict a continuous dependent variable using a **multiple linear regression** model.

The project follows a three-phase process:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** & assumption checking
2. **Model Building** & performance evaluation
3. **Interpreting Results** & making data-driven business recommendations

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice building a multiple linear regression model based on a business scenario.
- Apply EDA techniques to validate assumptions.
- Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics.
- Translate technical findings into strategic insights.
